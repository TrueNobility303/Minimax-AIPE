## News

* (2025/7) What happens if LEN meets A-LEN? We propose a new algorithm [C2] that breaks the conjectured barrier in minimax optimization, which was accepted by COLT'25 and got **Best Student Paper**!
* (2025/4) LEN [C1] is accected by ICLR'25 and got **Oral** presentation.
* (2025/1) We post Accelerated LEN [J1] on arXiv.
